# **IBM-Data-Science-Professional-Certificate-Applied-Data-Science-Capstone**

# Description: 
Data Science has been ranked as one of the hottest professions and the demand for data practitioners is booming. This Professional Certificate from IBM is intended for anyone interested in developing skills and experience to pursue a career in Data Science or Machine Learning.

This program consists of 10 courses providing you with latest job-ready skills and techniques covering a wide array of data science topics including: open source tools and libraries, methodologies, Python, databases, SQL, data visualization, data analysis, and machine learning. You will practice hands-on in the IBM Cloud using real data science tools and real-world data sets.

It is a myth that to become a data scientist you need a Ph.D. This Professional Certificate is suitable for anyone who has some computer skills and a passion for self-learning. No prior computer science or programming knowledge is necessary. We start small, re-enforce applied learning, and build up to more complex topics.

Upon successfully completing these courses you will have done several hands-on assignments and built a portfolio of data science projects to provide you with the confidence to plunge into an exciting profession in Data Science. In addition to earning a Professional Certificate from Coursera, you will also receive a digital Badge from IBM recognizing your proficiency in Data Science.

# Project Workflow:
## **1. Understand Business Problem**

## **2. Data Collection**
- Working with SpaceX launch data that is gathered from an API, specifically the SpaceX REST API
- This API will give data about launches, including information about the rocket used, payload delivered, launch specifications, landing specifications, and landing outcome
    - The API: api.spacexdata.com/v4/launches/past
- Wrangling Data using an API
- Web scraping Falcon 9 Launch records

## **3. Data Wrangling** 
### Outcome 
- We would like landing outcomes to be converted to Classes y (either 0 or 1)
    - 0 is a bad outcome i.e., the booster did not land
    - 1 is a good outcome i.e., the booster did land

## **4. Exploratory Data Analysis**
### Exploratory the Data
- Perform some exploratory data analysis using database
### Feature Engineering
- Some attributes can be used to determine if the first stage can be reused
- Determine what attributes are correlated with successful landings

## **5. Interactive Visual Analytics and Dashboards**
- Enable direct data exploration and analytics
- Zoom-in/out, Pan, Filter, Search, Link, etc.
- Identify patterns faster and more effectively
### Processing
-  Mark the launch site locations and their close proximities on an interactive map. Then explore the map with those markers and try to discover any patterns from them. Finally explain how to choose an optimal launch site.
-  Building a dashboard application with the Python Plotly Dash package. After the dashboard is built, can use it to find more insights from the SpaceX dataset more easily than with static graphs.
### Insights
- Now with the dashboard completed, we should be able to use it to analyze SpaceX launch data, and answer the following questions:
    - Which site has the largest successful launches?
    - Which site has the highest launch success rate?
    - Which payload range(s) has the highest launch success rate?
    - Which payload range(s) has the lowest launch success rate?
    - Which F9 Booster version (v1.0, v1.1, FT, B4, B5, etc.) has the highest launch success rate?

## **6. Predictive Model Building**
- Predict whether first stage of Falcon 9 will land succesfully

## **7. Presentation Findings**
